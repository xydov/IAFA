Moreno\n","\n","2023"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QVVgNtmF5b31"},"source":["## TP 3. Évaluation d’un système de recherche d'information\n","\n","L'évaluation est une étape complexe dans la recherche d'information. Une des conférences qui a  largement aidé à l'avancement en cette matière est la conférence TREC (http://trec.nist.gov/). Dans ce TP nous nous intéressons à l'utilisation d'une des ces outils pour l'évaluation des moteurs des recherche. \n","\n","Pour l'évaluation nous avons besoin d'un fichier qui contient la « vérité de terrain » ou « gold standard » qui est normalement appelé qrel. Ce fichier contient pour chaque requête les identifiants des documents pertinents et non-pertinents. Également, il est nécessaire d'avoir des fichiers des résultats du moteur de recherche à évaluer.\n","\n","Dans ce TP, nous allons utiliser un seul fichier qrel et plusieurs fichiers des résultats (chaque fichier des résultats sera évalué).\n","\n","En continuation avec le TP2, considérez la phrase « Thomas and Mario are strikers playing in Munich ». Elle sera transforme en 3 requêtes  « Thomas », « Mario » et « Munich ». Chaque requête aura de documents considérés comme correctes (relevants) et incorrectes (no relevants).  La recherche de documents sera faite par votre système de recherche d’information. Cependant, la fait de dire qu’un document est relevant est une étape manuelle. Nous allons considérer les documents suivants comme relevants pour chaque requête :\n","\n","> **Thomas** and **Mario** are strikers playing in **Munich**\n",">\n",">Thomas <br>\n",">* http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Müller\n",">\n",">\n",">Mario <br>\n",">* http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Gómez <br>\n",">* http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Götze\n",">\n",">\n",">Munich <br>\n",">* http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich\n","\n","Maintenant, il suffit d’utiliser vos résultats de chaque requête dans le format TREC pour les évaluer. Pour simplicité, nous allons utiliser la librarie [pytrec_eval](https://github.com/cvangysel/pytrec_eval) qui est un wrapper du logiciel [trec_eval](http://trec.nist.gov/trec_eval/trec_eval.8.1.tar.gz)\n","\n","Pour information, voici le fichier qrel pour les 3 requêtes précédentes :\n","\n","```\n","101 0 Thomas_Müller 1\n","101 0 Thomas_Edison 0\n","101 0 Thomas_the_Apostle 0\n","102 0 Mario_Gómez 1\n","102 0 Mario_Götze 1\n","103 0 FC_Bayern_Munich 1\n","```\n","\n","Notez que nous allons utiliser pytrec_eval, qui utilise un dictionaire pour le qrel au lieu d'un fichier.\n","\n","Notez que la première colonne est l’identifiant de la requête (nous avons trois valeurs différents, une pour chaque requête), suivi de zéro (0), suivi de l’identifiant du document annoté (le titre de la page Wikipédia) et une valeur pour dire si le document est relevant (1) ou non (0). Notez aussi que les qrels contient des documents pertinents et des documents non-pertinents.\n","\n","Puis il faut créer le fichier des résultats avec la sortie de votre programme fait pendant les Tps précédents. Pour information, voici un fichier résultat d’un système :\n","\n","```\n","101\tQ0\tThomas_Edison\t1\t  5.5\tSTANDARD\n","101\tQ0\tThomas_Müller\t2\t  4.4\tSTANDARD\n","101\tQ0\tThomas_the_Apostle\t3\t  3.3\tSTANDARD\n","101\tQ0\tIsiah_Thomas\t4\t  2.2\tSTANDARD\n","101\tQ0\tThomas_Aquinas\t5\t  1.1\tSTANDARD\n","102\tQ0\tMario\t1\t  5.5\tSTANDARD\n","102\tQ0\tSuper_Mario\t2\t  4.4\tSTANDARD\n","102\tQ0\tSuper_Mario_Bros.\t3\t  3.3\tSTANDARD\n","102\tQ0\tSuper_Mario_Bros._2\t4\t  2.2\tSTANDARD\n","102\tQ0\tMario_(series)\t5\t  1.1\tSTANDARD\n","102\tQ0\tSuper_Mario_World\t6\t  1.0\tSTANDARD\n","102\tQ0\tSuper_Mario_Bros._3\t7\t  0.9\tSTANDARD\n","102\tQ0\tNew_Super_Mario_Bros.\t8\t  0.8\tSTANDARD\n","102\tQ0\tMario_Gómez\t9\t  0.7\tSTANDARD\n","102\tQ0\tMario_Party_4\t10\t  0.6\tSTANDARD\n","103\tQ0\tMunich\t1\t  5.5\tSTANDARD\n","103\tQ0\tFC_Bayern_Munich\t2\t  4.4\tSTANDARD\n","103\tQ0\tMunich_Airport\t3\t  3.3\tSTANDARD\n","103\tQ0\tMunich_Agreement\t4\t  2.2\tSTANDARD\n","103\tQ0\tMunich_Rural_District\t5\t  1.1\tSTANDARD\n","```\n","\n","Notez, que comme pour les qrels, pytrec_eval utilise un dictionaire pour le résultat d’un système au lieu d'un fichier.\n","\n","La première colonne est l’identifiant de la requête (la même que pour le qrel), suivi de zéro (Q0), suivi de l’identifiant du document retrouvé par votre système (le titre de la page Wikipédia), suivi de la position du documents dans les résultats, suivi de la valeur de similarité donné par le modèle de poids choisi et de l’identifiant du système (votre nom par exemple).\n","\n","Une fois construit les fichiers qrels et résultats, nous pouvons utiliser le logiciel d'évaluation trec_eval pour obtenir les résultats de l'évaluation. Cependant, pour simplicité nous allons utiliser pytrec_eval. Donc, pour pytrec_eval, il suffit de déclarer les deux dictionaires (qrel et run) et en suite appeler la méthode ```relevanceEvaluator``` comme indiqué dans l'exemple ci-dessous.
